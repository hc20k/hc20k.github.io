                    <h2>What exactly are cellular automata?</h2><br>
                    Cellular automata is actually the plural version of a <c>cellular automaton</c> (aka CA for short).
                    A cellular automaton is a model of a system of "cell" objects with the following characteristics:
                    <br><br>

                    <li>Each cell lives on the same grid</li>
                    <li>Each cell has its own state (on or off, 0 or 1)</li>
                    <li>Each cell has a neighborhood, which are the cells that are close to it.</li>

                    <br>
                    The thing that I find interesting about cellular automata is that they look like they're alive.

                        <h2>Elementary CA</h2>
                        Let's try to build our first CA from scratch. It has to meet all of the characteristics:

                        A grid; a one dimensional grid is the simplest form of a grid.
                        <table class="cagrid"><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>
                        
                        Then, we have to fill up the grid with cells, and determine if each cell is dead or alive. I'll determine them randomly.
                        <table class="cagrid"><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

                        And finally, the cells have to have neighbors, which they do. In this example, a cells neighborhood are the cells around it, the one to the left and the
                        one to the right.
                        <table class="cagrid"><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td><c>0</c></td><td><c>1</c></td><td><c>0</c></td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>
                        
                        But this isn't even the surface of a cellular automaton, we haven't taken <c>time</c> or <c>generations</c> into account yet.
                    </div>

                    <div type="slideshow" stage=1 name="Generations">
                        <h2>Generations</h2>
                        In order for cellular automata to be cellular automata, they need to have <c>generations</c>. 
                        The CA have to live for a certain amount of time, and have to have rules indicating whether they can survive a generation or not.
                        <br><br>
                        A cell's new state in future generations are determined by the cells neighbors in the current generation. We can calculate a new state by
                        looking at its neighbors' states and using a <c>ruleset</c>.
                        <br><br>
                        A ruleset is <c>8 bits</c> because there are 8 possible neighborhood configurations. Here's an example ruleset <c>(Rule 90)</c>:
                        <br><br>
                        <c>0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0</c>
                        <br><br>
                        <img style="width: 50%;" src="assets/ca/ruleset.png" alt="">
                        <br><br>
                        Now, using that ruleset, we can determine the states of the cells in their future generations. This ruleset generates this design overtime:
                        <br><br>
                        <img style="width: 50%;" src="assets/ca/ruleset_gen.png" alt="" srcset="">
                        <br><br>
                        There are 256 possible rulesets.

                    <div type="slideshow" stage=2 name="Examples">
                        <h2>Examples</h2>
                        Now that we know what cellular automata and rulesets are, here are some examples of different rulesets that generate
                        some interesting results.

                        <h2>The Game of Life</h2>
                        In 1970, mathematician John Conway invented his "<c>Game of Life</c>". <c>The Game of Life</c> uses two
                        dimensional arrays instead of just one, and its goal is to simulate the natural world
                        in code. It simulates different biological systems like reproduction, life, and death.
                        Scientist Martin Gardner explained Conway's goals with his <c>Game of Life</c> pretty well:

                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>There should be no initial pattern for which there is a simple proof that the population can grow without limit.</li>
                            <li>There should be initial patterns that apparently do grow without limit.</li>
                            <li>There should be simple initial patterns that grow and change for a considerable period of time before coming to an end in three possible ways: fading away completely (from overcrowding or becoming too sparse), settling into a stable configuration that remains unchanged thereafter, or entering an oscillating phase in which they repeat an endless cycle of two or more periods.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4>But how does it actually work?</h4>

                        Since we use a 2D grid with the <c>Game of Life</c>, and all of the cells follow the rules of cellular automata, an example grid would look like this:
                        <br><br>
                        <img style="width: 40%;" src="assets/ca/gol_grid.png" alt="" srcset=""><br><br>

                        In the <c>Game of Life</c>, a cell has a neighborhood of <c>9</c> cells, including itself. Since we have nine
                        cells in a neighborhood, there's 9 bits, which means there's 512 possible neighborhoods. Because it would be
                        inconventient to provide an outcome for each individual cell, the Game of Life uses rules for the neighborhoods.
                        
                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>A cell will <c>die</c> if it has 4 or more alive neighbors, or if it has 1 or less neighbors.</li>
                            <li>A cell will <c>come back to life</c> if it has exactly 3 live neighbors.</li>
                            <li>If none of these conditions are met, the cell will maintain its state.</li>
                        </ol>
