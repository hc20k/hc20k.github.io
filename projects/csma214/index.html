                        For this assignment, we were asked to write a program in any language of our choice
                        that sorts a series of numbers using the <b>bubble sort</b> algorithm. I chose to
                        write this program in Python 3, using the numpy and Pygame modules. I also used sound in this
                        project, and a low / high frequency beep will play each time a value is sorted, a high frequency tone playing
                        if the value is high, and a low frequency tone playing when the value is low.

                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        This assignment was to make a visual implementation of elementary cellular automata
                        using Python 3 and PygameZero. My implementation lets the user implement a number
                        (1-256) to use as a ruleset, allows the cells to wrap around the game window, and has infinite scrolling
                        behavior.
                        <br><br>
                        The rulesets that I found most fascinating were rules 145, 190, and 120, shown on the righthand side of this section.

                        In this assigment we were asked to implement the rules of Conway's Game of Life, using Python 3
                        and PygameZero. For my implementation I added the "wrap around edges" behavior, as well as the ability
                        to spawn gliders and randomize every cell's state.

                        For this assignment, we were asked to implement the behavior of cellular automata
                        in 3D space using Unity. For my game I created a platformer, that has a floor where
                        each tile behaves like a cellular automaton when the player walks on it. The objective
                        of the game is to get past all the tiles without falling into the abyss.

                        For our midterm, we were asked to create a simulation or a game that
                        uses vectors and/or forces in 2D or 3D space. I created a small 2D simulation
                        where the player can use a cannon to shoot a ball into a hoop, and after
                        a certain amount of time the ball would explode and affect physics objects around
                        it. The targets placed around the level will fall if a bomb explodes next to it.

                        For this assignment we were given a template that generates fractals in Python
                        using the Processing module, and told to make our own remix of the implementation.
                        For mine, I attempted to create a tree out of the tree algorithm, complete with a sun and
                        grass on the ground. I also animated the fractals and the colors, so it appears as if the 
                        tree is alive.

                        were asked to make our own spinoff. For my spinoff, I created a storm simulation,
