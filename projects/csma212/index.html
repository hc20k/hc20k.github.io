            <p>
                This is a concept of an underground car exhibition made in TouchDesigner. I tried to use
                projection mapping as creatively as I could, by projecting on the cars and the walls. I also
                played around with ambient lighting and colors to further enforce an "underground" feeling. Even
                creativity has it's limits in TouchDesigner, I was going to place more lights in my scene but I was limited
                by TouchDesigner's 13 light limit.
