            The goal for this project was to make a prototype for a device that helps the wearer social distancing during the coronavirus using the M5StickC and a thermal sensor.
            I chose to build a program that can tell the user their level of safety while walking through their neighborhood or any public place. The program can also tell the user
            how many people they've encountered, and can be calibrated to adapt to environments with different tempuratures.
            <br> <br>
            It's also connected to adafruit.io in order to log how many people the user has encountered in a more organized form. Below is a screenshot of my adafruit.io feed, from 
            when I walked around my house.

            <img style="border-radius: 10px;padding:5px;" src="assets/adafruit.png" alt="Adafruit screenshot">

            The device connects to WiFi and logs to the Adafruit.io every 5 seconds, reporting how many people it noticed within that duration.

            Below is a more detailed write-up of this project, including an update log that I kept track of from start to finish.
